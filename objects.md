Object properties:

- All items can be dropped as objects

Material:
- Objects have a main constituent material.
- This affects the way it interacts.
- Some material could be flammable, others melt at higher temperatures.

Temperature:
- Objects have a temperature property
- Different temperatures can cause different effects
- This allows some things to happen without elemental magic
- Maybe can lead to emergent gameplay, eg. Randomly spawned barrel could be made of ice. Being near hot objects could then metal barrel, spilling its contents everywhere.
