- Either Levelling, Permadeath or Dungeon-Reset

Character Creation:
Players either choose or are randomly assigned a starting weapon. This will be the weapon they have the greatest skill in initially.
Players then choose 4 skills to take with them into the dungeon. (Not sure if this will be actual skills, or items that represent skills. eg Lockpicks, Screwdriver).
Character's stats are rolled within a good margin.
