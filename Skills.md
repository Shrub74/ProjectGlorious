# Introduction #

Not sure about subskills, currently. Need to work out a way to level things and make rewards without grinding.

Hopefully will have 24 or 32 skills without being too congestive

9/8/15: 
- 28 skills sounds like a good amount
- Skills will bind to 4 skill keys, which on an XBOX controller would be ABXY, on Keyboard, ZXCV, while weapon would be Right Trigger or Space or Click.
- Skills should affect the probability of personal loot, making loot occur more in favour of a player's current skills, eg, having Demolitions would increase the rate at which you loot bombs.
- Having a full set of related skills, eg, Magic or Rogue skills, affords a Set bonus to those skills.
- Skills are represented by inventory items as well
- Using a non-combat skill key will open a relevant context menu for that skill. Holding a certain key will open a relevant context menu for a combat skill, as well.

10/8/15:
- Some skills have cooldown based on their combat/puzzle effectiveness
- Some skills can have items that affect them, like extra spells
