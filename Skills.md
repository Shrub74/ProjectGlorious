# Introduction #

Not sure about subskills, currently. Need to work out a way to level things and make rewards without grinding.

Hopefully will have 24 or 32 skills without being too congestive

9/8/15: 
- 28 skills sounds like a good amount
- Skills will bind to 4 skill keys, which on an XBOX controller would be ABXY, on Keyboard, ZXCV, while weapon would be Right Trigger or Space or Click.
- Skills should affect the probability of personal loot, making loot occur more in favour of a player's current skills, eg, having Demolitions would increase the rate at which you loot bombs.
