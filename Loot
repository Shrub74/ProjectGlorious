- Loot can be dropped from monsters or gained from containers
- Loot can also be traded for with dungeon merchants
- Loot gained will be different for each player, not from a pool.
- Monsters will drop the same loot four times for everybody. (use a VisibleTo variable for this)
- At the end of dungeons, loot can be unlocked for further unlocking in dungeons, a la Binding of Isaac.
