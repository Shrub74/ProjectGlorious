Upon the server being booted, or host beginning a game (depending on implementation, hopefully both),
a character screen will be shown. This will have the design of 4 squares in each corner showing a player's initial status screen.
There will also be a screen in the middle or the bottom showing the selected Dungeon and it's settings (difficulty, etc.)


Each individual character screen will need to show:
- The player character's down-facing sprite
- The character's stat roll
- The character's chosen skills and weapon
- Other assorted things like options and controls

This may require a tabbed window.
